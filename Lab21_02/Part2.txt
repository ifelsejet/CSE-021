1. I used a total of 11 variables in my code

2. I used a double and an integer for my variable types.
I also had one instance variable for creating a Scanner.

3. I used the sample output as refrence for what types I should use. 
For example, when asking the user to list, it only took in 1 or 0, so
I figured I had to use an int. Since the user had to enter the amount in .5 
increments, I figured that I had to use a double. These are just a few examples
of how I decided what types each variable should be.

4. The difference is that println prints whatever it is supposed to and then moves
to the next line, so that the output doesn't get bunched up. Print will display the statement
and will continue on that very same line. Println will go to the next line after printing

5. I did use both. I used println mostly for listing the cheeses and I used print
for whenver I took input from the user since the sample input has it on the same line.

6. Well, the line "System.out.println();" by itself would display nothing to the user.
If the question refers to how println works, it would print whatver is inside the () to 
the user and then shift to the next line for further usage.
