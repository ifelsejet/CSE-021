1. An error will occur since MAXCHEESE is a constant variable and we are trying to re-assign it again.

1b. The data types of names,prices and amounts are in: String, double, double respectively.
1c. The numerical value of MAXCHEESE are the numbers of entries created
1d. These are all invalid, they are all being passed 1 (an int) when the types are different (String, Double, Double)

1e. After running those lines of code in Eclipse, I got:
Cheese A10
Cheese A10
Cheese 6510
Cheese K
Cheese 75

1f. The inital value of i is 3 since the first 3 cheeses are the "special" cheeses.
We want to get random cheeses after those 3, so we start randomizing after 3.Hence why
i is set to 3 to begin with. (0 is Humboldt Frog, 1 is Red Hawk, 2 is Teleme)

2) I re-used the while loop to check if a number is a multiple of 0.5 and greater than 0.
I also re-used the first introduction of code that lists the given cheeses.
I also used the same logic for displaying the list if the user wants

3) I used the random number generator,the given arrays, and the "We sell MAXCHEESE.." statement. I essentially copied
it over to GenCheeseShop and modified it.

4) I used a total of 6 loops 

5) I used a combo of for and while loops
