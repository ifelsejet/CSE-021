1. I really didn't copy and paste code from lab 2, I refrenced parts of it such as displaying the total amount and discounts for example.

2. I copied most of my code from Lab03, since it was very similar but I had to modify it to use functions.
I copied A,B,some of C, D, and E. 

3. I had to change the whole program here and there to make it work for this lab.
For example, I had to modify C to make it based off the length of an array rather than MAXCHEESE.
I had to make section F new, since, to me, the other labs didn't seem to overlap with F.
Generally speaking, I like to re-write my code from the beginning so I understand what is going, however
I do look at the other in case I forget something.

4. NOTE: Assuming that we are unable to change anything in main(), the following happens when the calcSubTotal method parameters are changed:
 i - Does not work, we are giving it a double and int and it expects a double and double.
ii - Does not work, we are giving it a double and int and it expects a double and double.
iii - It does work, we are feeding it a double and a double like it wanted
iv - Does not work, it is expecting a double and a double and we are giving it an int and a double
v - Does not work, it is expecting a double and a double and we are giving it a double and an int.

The reason why the majority of the function changes do not work is due to the fact that when we call the function in main, it is expecting a certain set of parameters (double, double) which we aren't matching.

If we are able to change main, the results would most likely change.
